# Hi. I'm Amir 👋

I'm a software engineer contractor at PIMCO.

I have a keen interest in automation and machine learning 🤖🧠. My journey has taken me through a diverse range of projects—from coding game bots using computer vision to experimenting with new technologies in demo projects. I believe in learning from every piece of code, so I rarely delete my experimental work—you can explore all of it here!

As we advance into the future of AI and robotics, I'm excited about the possibilities and hope to connect with others who share this enthusiasm. Let's explore what the future holds together!
