# Hi. I'm Amir ðŸ‘‹

I'm a software engineer contractor at PIMCO.

I have a keen interest in automation and machine learning ðŸ¤–ðŸ§ . My journey has taken me through a diverse range of projectsâ€”from coding game bots using computer vision to experimenting with new technologies in demo projects. I believe in learning from every piece of code, so I rarely delete my experimental workâ€”you can explore all of it here!
